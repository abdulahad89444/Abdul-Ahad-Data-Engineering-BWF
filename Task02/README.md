To connect to the RNAcentral database, use the following link: [RNAcentral Database Connection](https://rnacentral.org/help/public-database#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20downloadable%20files,available%20through%20the%20RNAcentral%20website).

## Tasks and SQL Query Files

### Task 1: RNA Structures Length and Year Filter

**Query File:** [prt1.sql](./prt1.sql)

### Task 2: Active Pre-computed RNA Records

**Query File:** [prt2.sql](./prt2.sql)

### Task 3: Total Records for snoRNA and tRNA by Year

**Query File:** [prt3.sql](./prt3.sql)

### Task 4: Databases Built for RNA with Specific Lengths

**Query File:** [prt4.sql](./prt4.sql)

### Task 5: Sequences for Active Regions by Chromosome and Exon Count

**Query File:** [prt5.sql](./prt5.sql)

## Query Outputs

The results of the SQL queries are documented in the `querry-Output.docx` file. You can refer to this file for the output of each query corresponding to the tasks mentioned above.

Please note that the `querry-Output.docx` file is not a text file, and you will need a compatible software (like Microsoft Word or Google Docs) to open and read it.

## Notes

- Each task has a corresponding SQL query file (`prt1.sql`, `prt2.sql`, etc.) that contains the query used to retrieve the required data.
- Ensure the database credentials and connection details are configured properly in PGAdmin4 before executing these queries.
- Modify the queries as necessary to match your specific database schema and environment.
